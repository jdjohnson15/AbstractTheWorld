# AbstractTheWorld
Playful mobile app that allows one person to remotely control another person, with their permission of course, using only drawings and text input. 

One person fires up the app as the server on a phone in a Googlecard-like device (camera must be exposed in the HMD). This person is "controlled" by the other person who fires up the app as a client. 
The server does not see this feed! The client can trace over the camera feed or type words to send to the server, and that's only what the server can see. It's up to the client to help the server navigate around the world.

##Getting Started

The included .apk files should be able to install the app onto any android mobile device. Simply download them to the mobile devices you wish to use and install.

Both devices must be on the same local network.

The server will indicate when someone connects. Once this connection is established, the client will see the server's camera feed.

##Fun things to do!

* Have a third person hide an object in a room. The server-client duo must retreive the object.
* Have two server-client teams race through a (safe!) obstacle course.
